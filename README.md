# Tourist-Destinations-Website

This project is a simple Tourist Website created as part of our Midterm Examination BSIT 2nd year student. It showcases popular tourist destinations across Asia, Europe, and America, providing brief descriptions and images for each location. The website is built using HTML and CSS with structured sections, navigation links, and smooth scrolling to enhance user experience. This project demonstrates the application of basic web development concepts, including page layout, navigation, and content organization, while presenting information in a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate format.
